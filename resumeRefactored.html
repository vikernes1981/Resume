                        <h2>Summary</h2> 
                        <p>I am Remi Cracktooth, a formidable female dwarf rogue known for my no-nonsense attitude and fierce determination. Standing shorter than most but with an imposing presence,
                        I have a reputation for collecting debts with ruthless efficiency. My nickname, "Cracktooth," stems from my signature method of dealing with defaulters: breaking their teeth 
                        as a brutal reminder to honor their obligations. Skilled in stealth, lockpicking, and combat, I move through the shadows with ease, ensuring that debts are paid and respect is maintained.
                        Despite my harsh methods, I have a code of honor and protect those loyal to me fiercely.
